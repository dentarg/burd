# Burd

## Overview
Opinionated personal URL shortener which runs on [Heroku][1] and uses [Redis to
go][2] as a backend. Shortening is done through the fabulous [Guillotine][3]
engine and its Redis adapter.

If you set `HTTP_USER` and `HTTP_PASS` all methods except `GETs` require basic
authentication.

## Usage
You can use it exactly as any other guillotine app:

    curl -X POST http://sho.rt --user foo:bar -i -F"url=http://github.com" -F"code=gh"

## Features
- Authentication
- Custom [Tweetbot][7] compatible endpoint
- Gauges support (to come)

## Setup

    git clone git://github.com/mrtazz/katana.git
    cd katana
    heroku apps:create
    heroku addons:add redistogo
    heroku domains:add sho.rt
    git push heroku master
    heroku config:set HTTP_USER="theuser"
    heroku config:set HTTP_PASS="thepass"

### Tweetbot
There is a custom endpoint which is compatible with how tweetbot expects custom
URL shorteners to behave. Activate it by setting

    TWEETBOT_API=true

in your environment variables. After that you can add URLs with a `GET` to

    http://sho.rt/api/create/?url=http://github.com

Keep in mind that this endpoint is not authenticated.

## Thanks

[s3itch][6] which somehow got me started wanting a personal URL shortener.
